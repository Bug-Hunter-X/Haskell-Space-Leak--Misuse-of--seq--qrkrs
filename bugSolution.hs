The solution uses the `deepseq` package, which provides a `deepseq` function that forces the complete evaluation of a data structure to normal form.  This ensures that all parts of the structure are evaluated and can be garbage collected when they are no longer needed.

```haskell
import Control.DeepSeq

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = expensiveComputation
      y = someOtherComputation x
  deepseq x $ print y -- Force complete evaluation of x before printing y

-- Example of an expensive computation
expensiveComputation :: [Integer]
expensiveComputation = [1..1000000]

-- Example of another computation that depends on x
someOtherComputation :: [Integer] -> Integer
someOtherComputation xs = sum xs
```
By using `deepseq x`, we force the complete evaluation of `x` before any further computations. This approach prevents the space leak by ensuring all parts of `x` are evaluated and can be garbage collected.
